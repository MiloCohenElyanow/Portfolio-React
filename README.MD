# Milo Cohen-Elyanow React Portfolio Website

## Description

  This is a Full stack application written mostly with React, it contains comprehensive examples on agreeable ways to use react. Most importantly this is a website for me to show off my work. I want those who aren't coding literate to be able to see and appreciate my work for what it is, and I hope this website fulfills that need.
You can view this website live [here](https://www.milocohenelyanow.com/)

## Why?

  As a blossoming web developer I want to show of my work that I have done so far in an enticing way. I also want to show possible future employers what my work is in a comprehensive manner. This is where I can make a great website to accomplish both of these tasks. In addition this has been a great way to get to know styling, and front end components more with react, it took me a while to get this done because I'm not much for front end work to be completely honest, nor am I even slightly comfortable with graphic design. So this was an excellent challenge for me!

## Tech Stack

## Usage

  If your wanting to check out this website from the source code and mess about with it. You can download the source code from my [repo](https://github.com/MiloCohenElyanow/Portfolio-React). Once you do that run {npm i} in the root of this project, then run{npm run build} to create an new next js optimized build, and then {npm run start} to start your front-end/back-end connection! the console will generate your localhost link so you can click on it and view your locally hosted website! Theres almost no back end code here since this is just a portfolio, but the front end has some sweet styling and assets, and some clean react code with some great examples I wrote that should be comprehensible for learning! Please feel free to use this project however you want, if you use this project commercially I do appreciate credit but by no means is it necessary!
